\section{What is \LaTeX?}
\LaTeX is a document preparation system used widely for the communication and publication of scientific documents like articles. It allows precise control over structure and formatting, making it the preferred tool in academia and research.
\section{Why Use \LaTeX?}
Unlike word processors,
\LaTeX separates content from formatting. This makes large documents easier to maintain and more consistent. Features like automatic numbering, bibliography management, and cross-referencing are built in to
\LaTeX of course.

\section{Chapter Structure}
LaTeX uses a hierarchical structure based on chapters, sections, and subsections. This makes it easy to organize complex documents such as books, theses, and articles.
\section{Managing Content}
Content in LaTeX can be split across multiple files and included using the
\begin{verbatim}
\input
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
\include
\end{verbatim}
commands. This helps keep files manageable when collaborating or working on large projects. Figure
\ref{fig:latex-logo}
shows the LaTeX logo.
