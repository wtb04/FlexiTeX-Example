\section{Chapter Structure}
LaTeX uses a hierarchical structure based on chapters, sections, and subsections. This makes it easy to organize complex documents such as books, theses, and articles.
\section{Managing Content}
Content in LaTeX can be split across multiple files and included using the
\begin{verbatim}
\input
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
\include
\end{verbatim}
commands. This helps keep files manageable when collaborating or working on large projects. Figure
\ref{fig:latex-logo}
shows the LaTeX logo.
