\section{Managing Content}
Content in LaTeX can be split across multiple files and included using the

\begin{verbatim}\input\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}\include\end{verbatim}

commands. This helps keep files manageable when collaborating or working on large projects. Figure \ref{fig:latex-logo} shows the LaTeX logo.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/logo.png}
    \caption{The LaTeX logo used as an example figure.}
    \label{fig:latex-logo}
\end{figure}
